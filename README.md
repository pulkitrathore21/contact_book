# contact_book
I have uploaded zip file of my project.
1)extract the zip file.
2)I have used postgresql database for save my contact.

#For running project -:
1)run the fate.py
2)In ContactApi.py i have written apis for CRUD operation.
3)In models.py I have define my models.
 3)I am storing it into Db and giving the response into json.


Concerns:-
i)I have concern about I have upload the image file by encode it into string but I am not getting any idea about how to convert that again into image file.
ii) When I am trying to do this project by making saperate modules then I am having some errors so I tried everything in the same file.
